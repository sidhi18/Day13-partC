# Java String Methods - Practice Task

This repository contains basic Java programs demonstrating the use of common `String` methods. These programs are part of my Full Stack Developer journey and were completed on **31/07/2025**.

## ✅ Methods Practiced:
- `concat()`
- `split()`
- `isEmpty()`
- `isBlank()`
- `intern()`
- `valueOf()`
- `toString()`

## 📁 File Structure:
- Each method has its own example inside the main class.
- Outputs are printed to the console to help understand how each method behaves.

## 🧠 Objective:
To get hands-on practice and understanding of Java’s built-in `String` class and its commonly used methods before moving to advanced concepts.
